  o Major bugfixes:
    - Stop sending a CLOCK_SKEW controller status event whenever
      we fetch directory information from a relay that has a wrong clock.
      Instead, only inform the controller when it's a trusted authority
      that claims our clock is wrong. Bugfix on tor-0.1.2.6-alpha;
      fixes the other half of bug 1074.
